## Placeholder Icons

Until proper icons are created, you can use any 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files with the correct names.

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:
- Design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe Illustrator

- Simple graphics editors like GIMP or Photoshop
- AI-powered icon generators

Make sure to optimize the files for web use and keep file sizes reasonable for the extension package.
